Create a NodeJS app that makes an HTTP request to https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/eesti

## To get '3'
 - make and HTTP request using 'request' package (the package has been depricated but is still fully functioning)
 - when a user calls on localhost:3000, the page displays the following data from the API:
Name: Estonia
Region: Europe, Northern Europe
Calling Code: 372
Language: Estonian
Population: 1315944
Top Level Domain: .ee
Alpha3 Code: EST
Currency: €

## To get 4 or higher
- make and HTTP request using 'request' package (the package has been depricated but is still fully functioning), as alternative I strongly recommend using https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios
- the data from the controller (server.js) is passed to a ejs template using <%= > markers
- when a user calls on localhost:3000, the page displays the following data from the API:
Name: Estonia
Region: Europe, Northern Europe
Calling Code: 372
Language: Estonian
Population: 1315944
Top Level Domain: .ee
Alpha3 Code: EST
Currency: €

NB! The flag image must be included
- the displayed page is nicely styled in a separate css file.

You may work in small groups of two people.
